## 🎯 Technical Implementation

### Pose Analysis Algorithm
```python
def analyze_squat_form(landmarks):
    # Calculate joint angles for hips, knees, ankles
    hip_angle = calculate_angle(landmarks[23], landmarks[24], landmarks[26])
    knee_angle = calculate_angle(landmarks[24], landmarks[26], landmarks[28])
    
    # Form logic
    if knee_angle < 90:
        return "Perfect squat depth! Maintain neutral spine."
    elif knee_angle > 120:
        return "Go deeper! Knees should form 90-degree angle."
```

### Performance Metrics Tracked
- Joint angles and alignment
- Range of motion
- Exercise tempo and consistency
- Form deviations and corrections
